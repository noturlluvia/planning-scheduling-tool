# FocusFlow

FocusFlow is an iOS task management application designed to help users organize their tasks and subtasks efficiently, with built-in countdown timers for each subtask. The app allows users to manage their tasks with different priorities, track time spent on each subtask, and monitor overall progress.

## Features
- Create and manage tasks with custom titles, start dates, due dates, and priority levels.
- Add and manage subtasks with individual countdown timers.
- Track the completion of tasks and subtasks.
- Intuitive UI with dynamic task and subtask organization.

### Updates
- **Resolved Issue**: Enhanced the `TaskCreationView` by adding explicit "Edit" buttons for subtasks, making it easier for users to adjust `timeBlocks` directly.
- **New Feature WIP**: Plan to add a calendar view to manage and view tasks more visually. This will help users see their tasks laid out over days and weeks, making planning more interactive and accessible.
